    "## Overview\n",
    "---\n",
    "This repository for the Behavioral Cloning Project.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we will use convolutional neural networks to clone driving behavior. The model was trained, validated and tested using Keras. The model will output a steering angle to an autonomous vehicle.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project require a simulator where we can steer a car around a track for data collection. We'll use image data and steering angles to train a neural network and then use this model to drive the car autonomously around the track.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "File structure: \n",
    "* model.py (script used to create and train the model)\n",
    "* drive.py (script to drive the car - feel free to modify this file)\n",
    "* model.h5 (a trained Keras model)\n",
    "* a report writeup file\n",
    "* video.mp4 (a video recording of your vehicle driving autonomously around the track for at least one full lap)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Project\n",
    "---\n",
    "The goals / steps of this project:\n",
    "* Use the simulator to collect data of good driving behavior \n",
    "* Design, train and validate a model that predicts a steering angle from image data\n",
    "* Use the model to drive the vehicle autonomously around the first track in the simulator. The vehicle should remain on the road for an entire loop around the track.\n",
    "* Summarize the results with a written report\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dependencies\n",
    "This lab requires:\n",
    "\n",
    "* [CarND Term1 Starter Kit](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Term1-Starter-Kit)\n",
    "\n",
    "The lab enviroment can be created with CarND Term1 Starter Kit. Click [here](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Term1-Starter-Kit/blob/master/README.md) for the details.\n",
    "\n",

    "## How to run the code\n",
    "\n",
    "##### `drive.py`\n",
    "\n",
    "Usage of `drive.py` requires you have saved the trained model as an h5 file, i.e. `model.h5`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "python drive.py model.h5\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The above command will load the trained model and use the model to make predictions on individual images in real-time and send the predicted angle back to the server via a websocket connection.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: There is known local system's setting issue with replacing \",\" with \".\" when using drive.py. When this happens it can make predicted steering values clipped to max/min values. If this occurs, a known fix for this is to add \"export LANG=en_US.utf8\" to the bashrc file.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Saving a video of the autonomous agent\n",
    "\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "python drive.py model.h5 run1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The fourth argument, `run1`, is the directory in which to save the images seen by the agent. If the directory already exists, it'll be overwritten.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "ls run1\n",
    "\n",
